![Build status](https://github.com/function61/html2pdf/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

What?
-----

A small microservice that turns HTML into a PDF file. You can run this:

- on AWS Lambda
- with Docker
  * I didn't bother making a `Dockerfile` though, since I didn't need it. PR welcome!
- as a standalone binary

There also exists [a small client library for Go](pkg/html2pdfclient/)


Security
--------

While we're confident in this project's code, ultimately this is a wrapper to wkhtmltopdf, and thus
you should be aware of its [status](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/status.html#recommendations) and its
security considerations:

- Do not use with untrusted HTML. Only render HTML that you control.
- whtmltopdf uses QtWebKit that hasnâ€™t been updated since 2012
	* Qt abandoned QtWebkit in favor or QtWebEngine which uses Chromium internally


Testing
-------

You can start a local server process with:

```console
$ html2pdf server
```

Then call it from the client:

```console
$ export HTML2PDF_TOKEN="doesntMatter" # optionally you can put the service behind authentication
$ html2pdf client-localhost '<h1>hello world</h1>' > out.pdf
```

Usage from curl is also simple:

```console
$ curl -d '{"html_base64": "PGgxPmhlbGxvIHdvcmxkPC9oMT4="}' http://localhost/render > out.pdf
```


Prerequisites for dev/testing
-----------------------------

```console
$ apt install -y libxrender1 libxext6 libfontconfig1
```

(Fortunately, these exist in Lambda's AMI)
